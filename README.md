## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

LocalDrop is designed to be easily customizable through the `config.js` file. This central configuration allows you to personalize the donation system without modifying the core files.

### Basic Configuration

### Payment Method Configuration

Set up your donation methods with properties like ID, name, logo path, QR code path, address, and referral information.

### UI Settings

Customize UI elements like the initial tab to display, footer text, and back button text.


## üß© Customizing QR Codes

Replace the default QR codes with your own:

1. Generate QR codes for your payment addresses using any QR code generator
2. Save them in the `assets/QR/` folder following this naming convention:
   - `BinancePay_qr.png` - For Binance Pay
   - `RedotPay_qr.png` - For Redotpay
   - `USDT bnb.png`, `USDT tron.png`, etc. - For various USDT networks


## üöß Roadmap
